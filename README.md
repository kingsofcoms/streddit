Post reddit (and hacker news and other RSS) content on steemit

# Motivation

Steemit pays me for content and I like that. Reddit and Hacker News dont pay me so I an exiting stage left. That being said, they provide excellent news that I want. My job is just to provide a newsfeed for refugees from those sites. If you want more information, then you must visit their sites.

I think this is an excellent exchange of value.
